Hello, I'm Newton Armstrong

Full-Stack Developer + Data Alchemist
Building bridges between raw data and transformative user experiences

ðŸ’¼ What I Do Best:

Craft bulletproof web apps with React, Next.js, and Node.js

Turn chaos into insights using Python/SQL and sleek dashboards

Optimize systems that handle real financial data (30% faster queries at KCB Bank)

Speak both "business" and "code" (thanks to my math/statistics background)

ðŸ”¥ Recent Wins:
âœ… Built 10+ production apps for SMEs (40% traffic boost via Next.js SSR)
âœ… Automated fintech reporting workflows, saving 15+ hours/week
âœ… Designed analytics dashboards that drove 20% higher user engagement

ðŸ›  My Tech Playground:
JavaScript React Node.js Next.js Python PostgreSQL MongoDB AWS Data Visualization

ðŸ“ˆ Why I Stand Out:

"I don't just write code â€“ I solve real business problems. At Coded Alex, my dashboards helped clients increase conversions by analyzing user behavior. 

At KCB Bank, I automated processes that saved thousands of operational hours. My hybrid skills in development AND data let me build solutions that are as smart as they are functional."

ðŸŒ± Currently Leveling Up:

Building AI-powered fintech tools

Mastering cloud architecture (AWS/GCP)

Contributing to open-source data viz projects
